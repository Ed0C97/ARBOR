# A.R.B.O.R. Vibe Ontology
# Defines the semantic framework for "Vibe" analysis

ontology:
  name: "Vibe DNA"
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Multi-dimensional semantic scoring system for entity characterization"

# Core concept: every entity has a Vibe DNA
# Vibe DNA is a set of dimensional scores (0-100)
# combined with semantic anchors and context rules
